The purpose of the practice is to develop essential visual communication skills. \nSince the very beginning of the class, our instructor has always been reaffirming that drawing is not about artistic styles, but rather about conveying our message to our audience. There are no such things as bad drawings, and the preconceived idea that childish drawings are bad drawings hinders people from trying and truly making improvements in their visual communication.\nSo, I started dabbling into this novel practice with a mentality different from what I once had. I identified my purpose of drawing as to summarize my readings, as well as to add a \u201clayer\u201d of my own understanding of the topic to my work. \nThe first reading Syllabus is a guide to drawing, so I spent a lot of time just doing the same practice the book tells us to do, like drawing a house on fire, drawing an imaginative car, drawing a demon you imagine, drawing a castle within a few seconds. I also wrote down important ideas I learned from the book, such as the interconnection among the concept \u201cimitation\u201d, \u201cmemorization\u201d, and \u201cconcentration\u201d. I drew these concepts in nodes and connected them in a that resembles a \u201ccircular linked list\u201d. These useful ideas became something ingrained in my mind. Especially, there was a practice from which I learn the most: drawing anything trivial that I recalled and weaving it into a story. During the process of sketching, I sometimes found it difficult to find what things I should draw. Despite the sundry events and phenomena that happen every day, A careless person like me may not be able to heed every detail in life. To fulfill the requirements of the assignment, I had to spend a few minutes drawing swirls to calm myself down, meanwhile meditating and scanning through all the things that happened on that day. I could, therefore, find something I previously would just brush off, like seeing a blocked toilet! The activity truly made me a more heeded and detail-oriented person.\nTo be honest, I did not like the first reading as much as I like the second reading Unflattening, which talks about the \u201cphilosophy\u201d of seeing through multiple perspectives. Since the book is of a completely different genre, I tried to switch my genres of drawing, too. This time, I included a lot of imitation of the illustrations in the book, and my style became more realistic. For example, my drawing of the puppet person for the 2/5 reading almost perfectly resembles the original drawing: different parts of his body harmonized in color and proportion. Meanwhile, my drawings also became more abstract. For the first time, I became able to summarize the readings by drawing symbolizing imageries. For instance, I juxtaposed a pair of eyes with a telescope so epitomize the way we human beings see farther and farther quest after truth. I also draw a map of Manhattan with different subway routes connecting one point to the other to illustrate the concept that \u201cthere is not a single way\u201d. Both my drawing skills and my ability to convey my understanding of the reading materials improved significantly.\n"}),n.a.createElement(y,{icon:w.d,title:"I Found My Own Style!",content:"The greatest enhancement in my visual communication came as more and more readings are assigned.

I made use of this though in almost all my following sketch notes, as I always wrote down the common theme in my notes.

Also, if your drawing reflects you as a real person, then there is no such thing as a bad drawing.
